<H2>5. Features / Highlights</H2>
   
🔎 Business Problem

In a competitive e-commerce environment, businesses generate massive transactional data daily. However, without structured analysis, it becomes difficult to answer critical questions such as:

• Which product categories generate the highest revenue?

• Which regions contribute most to total sales?

• What are the monthly sales trends?

• Which customer segments are most profitable?

• Where are profit margins declining?

Raw data alone cannot quickly provide these insights.

To develop an interactive business intelligence solution that:

• Monitors overall sales and profit performance

• Identifies top-performing products and regions

• Tracks monthly and yearly revenue trends

• Analyzes customer purchasing behavior
