🔎 Business Problem

In a competitive e-commerce environment, businesses generate massive transactional data daily. However, without structured analysis, it becomes difficult to answer critical questions such as:

•Which product categories generate the highest revenue?

•Which regions contribute most to total sales?

•What are the monthly sales trends?

•Which customer segments are most profitable?

•Where are profit margins declining?

Raw data alone cannot quickly provide these insights.
